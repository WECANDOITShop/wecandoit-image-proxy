4. Click **"Commit changes"**

### Then:

Netlify should **automatically redeploy** when you commit. If not:

1. Go back to Netlify
2. Click **"Retry deploy"** button (you can see it in your first screenshot)

The deployment should succeed this time!

## After it deploys successfully:

You'll see a green checkmark and your site will be live. Then you can:

1. Get your site URL (something like `fabulous-clafoutis-7122c6.netlify.app`)
2. Your function will be at:
```
   https://fabulous-clafoutis-7122c6.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/convert-image
